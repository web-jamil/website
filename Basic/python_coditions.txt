### **Basic Conditional Syntaxes in Python**

Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute code blocks based on conditions. Here’s a detailed breakdown of all basic conditional syntaxes with examples and descriptions.

---

## **1. `if` Statement**

### **Syntax**:
```python
if condition:
    # Code block to execute if the condition is True
```

- The `if` statement evaluates the `condition`. If it is `True`, the indented block of code runs.
- If it is `False`, the block is skipped.

### **Example**:
```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")  # Output: x is greater than 5
```

---

## **2. `if-else` Statement**

### **Syntax**:
```python
if condition:
    # Code block to execute if the condition is True
else:
    # Code block to execute if the condition is False
```

- The `else` block runs only if the `if` condition is `False`.

### **Example**:
```python
x = 3
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")  # Output: x is not greater than 5
```

---

## **3. `if-elif-else` Statement**

### **Syntax**:
```python
if condition1:
    # Code block if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Code block if condition2 is True
else:
    # Code block if all conditions are False
```

- Use `elif` (short for else-if) to check multiple conditions sequentially.
- The `else` block is optional and runs if none of the conditions are `True`.

### **Example**:
```python
x = 10
if x < 5:
    print("x is less than 5")
elif x == 10:
    print("x is equal to 10")  # Output: x is equal to 10
else:
    print("x is greater than 10")
```

---

## **4. Nested `if` Statements**

### **Syntax**:
```python
if condition1:
    if condition2:
        # Code block if both condition1 and condition2 are True
    else:
        # Code block if condition1 is True and condition2 is False
else:
    # Code block if condition1 is False
```

- You can nest `if` statements to handle more complex logic.

### **Example**:
```python
x = 10
y = 20
if x > 5:
    if y > 15:
        print("Both conditions are True")  # Output: Both conditions are True
    else:
        print("Only the first condition is True")
else:
    print("The first condition is False")
```

---

## **5. Ternary Conditional Operator (One-Line `if-else`)**

### **Syntax**:
```python
value = true_value if condition else false_value
```

- A shorthand way to write `if-else` in a single line.

### **Example**:
```python
x = 10
result = "Positive" if x > 0 else "Negative"
print(result)  # Output: Positive
```

---

## **6. Logical Operators in Conditions**

### **Syntax with Logical Operators**:
```python
if condition1 and condition2:
    # Code block if both conditions are True

if condition1 or condition2:
    # Code block if at least one condition is True

if not condition:
    # Code block if condition is False
```

- **`and`**: Both conditions must be `True` to execute the block.
- **`or`**: At least one condition must be `True` to execute the block.
- **`not`**: Negates the condition.

### **Example**:
```python
x, y = 10, 20

if x > 5 and y > 15:
    print("Both conditions are True")  # Output: Both conditions are True

if x < 5 or y > 15:
    print("At least one condition is True")  # Output: At least one condition is True

if not (x < 5):
    print("x is not less than 5")  # Output: x is not less than 5
```

---

## **7. Membership Operators in Conditions**

### **Syntax**:
```python
if item in iterable:
    # Code block if item is in iterable

if item not in iterable:
    # Code block if item is not in iterable
```

- **`in`**: Checks if an item exists in an iterable (e.g., string, list, tuple).
- **`not in`**: Checks if an item does not exist in an iterable.

### **Example**:
```python
word = "apple"
if "a" in word:
    print("Found 'a'")  # Output: Found 'a'

if "z" not in word:
    print("'z' is not in the word")  # Output: 'z' is not in the word
```

---

## **8. Identity Operators in Conditions**

### **Syntax**:
```python
if object1 is object2:
    # Code block if both objects refer to the same memory location

if object1 is not object2:
    # Code block if both objects do not refer to the same memory location
```

- **`is`**: Checks if two objects share the same memory reference.
- **`is not`**: Checks if two objects do not share the same memory reference.

### **Example**:
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
if a is not b:
    print("Different objects")  # Output: Different objects
```

### **Summary of Conditional Syntax**

| **Statement**    | **Purpose**                                                  | **Example**                                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `if`             | Executes a block if the condition is `True`.                 | `if x > 0: print("Positive")`                           |
| `if-else`        | Executes one block if `True`, another if `False`.            | `if x > 0: ... else: ...`                               |
| `if-elif-else`   | Checks multiple conditions in order.                         | `if x < 0: ... elif x == 0: ... else: ...`              |
| Nested `if`      | Executes `if` statements inside other `if` blocks.           | `if x > 0: if y > 0: ...`                               |
| Ternary Operator | One-line shorthand for `if-else`.                            | `result = "Yes" if x > 0 else "No"`                     |
| Logical Operators| Combines multiple conditions.                                | `if x > 0 and y > 0: ...`                               |
| Membership       | Checks if an item exists in or not in an iterable.           | `if "a" in word: ...`                                   |
| Identity         | Compares objects by memory location.                         | `if a is b: ...`                                        |

These conditionals provide the foundation for controlling the flow of programs in Python.
